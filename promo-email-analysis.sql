-- QUESTION: We should email people a picture of what they looked at most recently!


-- 1. Format the view_item event from events table into 
	-- a table with the appropriate columns (view_item_events table)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS view_item_events AS

	-- about the item they viewed more recently. 
	-- Make sure they are named appropriately so that another human can 
	-- read and understand their contents.

	-- If we sent an email to everyone in the results of this query, 
    -- what would we want to filter out.

    -- For example should we include deleted users? Should we send this email 
    -- to users who already ordered the item they viewed most recently?
